Welcome to my new personal website! After much consideration about technology choices and workflow, I've finally settled on a setup that feels both modern and maintainable.

## Why Astro?

After evaluating various static site generators including Jekyll, Next.js, and Hugo, I chose Astro for several compelling reasons:

- **Performance First**: Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, making sites incredibly fast
- **Framework Agnostic**: I can use React, Vue, or vanilla HTML/CSS as needed
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and a gentle learning curve
- **Content-Focused**: Perfect for a personal website that's primarily about sharing content

## What's Here

This website serves as my digital home where I'll be sharing:

- **Technical Blog Posts**: Insights, tutorials, and lessons learned from development work
- **Project Showcases**: Detailed breakdowns of interesting projects I've worked on
- **Personal Reflections**: Thoughts on the software industry, career development, and continuous learning

## The Tech Stack

For those curious about the technical details, this site is built with:

- **Astro** for static site generation
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment
- Simple, semantic HTML and CSS for styling (no framework needed!)

## Simple Workflow

One thing I'm particularly happy with is the streamlined workflow:

1. Write content in Markdown files
2. Run `npm run dev` to preview locally
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys

No complex build systems, no unnecessary complications - just content creation and deployment.

## What's Next

I'm excited to start sharing more content regularly. Some topics you can expect in upcoming posts:

- Deep dives into interesting coding problems
- Reviews of new tools and technologies
- Personal experiences and lessons learned
- Project walkthroughs and case studies

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful or interesting here. Feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/contact/) if you'd like to connect!
